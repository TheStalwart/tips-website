After 25+ years of custom PC building and troubleshooting, i must admit the bullshit never ends. Consoles exist for a reason.

## Random PC Tips

- Always check date and time are set correctly. No app will warn you about suspicious date, you'll just waste time troubleshooting seemingly random bugs and crashes.
- Do not assume modular PSU cords are interchangeable. Corsair alone have [5+ different pin layouts](https://cablemod.com/compatibility/). It's usually cheaper to replace a PSU than to release a magic smoke out of GPU.
- PS/2 was never designed for [hot-plugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_swapping). Usually you need to restart the PC for keyboard and mouse to work.
