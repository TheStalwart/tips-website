## Charger compatibility
GPD Pocket requires 9V USB-PD mode for charging, and therefore is incompatible with Nintendo Switch charger HAC-002 that can only do 5V and 15V. 

Make sure amber LED on power button is on when performing OS and BIOS updates.

## USB-C dongle compatibility
Quite a few reviews of this device mention issues with external display support through USB-C. These issues seem to be fixed now. 

With Windows 11 23H2, BIOS and drivers updated, compatible dongle, and quality 9V USB-PD charger - i can use GPD Pocket with external 1080p display and battery level goes up even during high CPU utilization.
