## Controllers

DualShock 3 controllers cannot be charged with generic USB chargers. If you have a "dead" controller, try plugging it into the running PS3 console and leaving for a few hours.

## PlayStation 1 Emulation

If you have a game in CUE/BIN format, converting it to ISO format might break it. Confirmed with [Crash Team Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Team_Racing)
