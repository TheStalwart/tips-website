## Controllers

DualShock 3 controllers cannot be charged with generic USB chargers. If you have a "dead" controller, try plugging it into the running PS3 console and leaving for a few hours.

## PlayStation 1 Emulation

If you have a game in CUE/BIN format, converting it to ISO format might break it. Confirmed with [Crash Team Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Team_Racing)

## Save file lock-in

While original firmware allows copying save files to/from USB drive (no need for paid subscription) the saves are:

- tied to a specific build/region of the game
- tied to a specific account

Evilnat Custom Firmware includes a tool to change save file ownership, but you still need a matching build/region of the game to load them.
