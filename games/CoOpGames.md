## Borderlands

A series of looter shooters with fairly open world and lots of side quests. Cooperation is class/role based, and in earler games of the series loot drops are shared, so players must choose who takes each item.

Games can be played on LAN or over internet, but will always be split-screen as it's developer's artistic choice. Unless _both_ players insist on using keyboard and mouse, playing on a single big screen is most enjoyable. On PC, one player can use keyboard and mouse while other player is using a controller. Which input controls which character can be set when starting a campaign.

## Portal 2

Valve's first person puzzle has a separate campaign to be played in 2-person cooperative mode. Puzzles are much harder than singleplayer campaign and require knowledge of base game mechanics, but is very enjoyable for players who beat singleplayer campaign.

The game is available for any potato PC, as well as Linux, Mac, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

Split-screen on PC has technical challenges, but there's [a guide with workarounds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=239373369).
