# Gears of War

Series of third person shooter games with excellent story-heavy singleplayer/co-op campaigns.

Development of the first trilogy was lead by [Cliff Bleszinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Bleszinski), previously known for Unreal and [Unreal Tournament](/games/UnrealTournament99.md) series.

As of Q1 2025, you will need Xbox360 (or newer) Console to play _all_ mainline games of the series. Remasters of GoW 2 and 3 for PC were announced, to be released in late 2025.

[Xbox Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-game-pass/ultimate) is the most cost-efficient way if your goal is to enjoy all the story of singleplayer/co-op campaigns.

It seems to be undocumented feature, but it's possible to play co-op on 2x PCs with just one Game Pass subscription. Log into Xbox app with the account having active Game Pass subscription to install and run games for the first time, then close the game and let _Player 2_ log into Xbox app. He can then run the game and join a co-op squad hosted by Game Pass holding account. Exception is DLC content - it will trigger extra DRM verification and kick out players who don't have proof of ownership.

## Gears of War (1)

Playable on PC, Xbox Series and Xbox One, [Ultimate Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH3SHM5) is _the_ way to play the first game of the series. It has graphics and soundtrack remastered, several cutscenes were completely overhauled, and alternative ending has been implemented to tease the following games of the series.

Split-screen co-op is not available on PC, it's a feature exclusive to console version.

The original Xbox360 release [is compatible with Xbox Series and Xbox One consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_backward-compatible_games_for_Xbox_One_and_Series_X/S), but if you're set to play the entire series - there's no reason to choose this edition over Ultimate.

## Gears of War 2

This game is Xbox360 exclusive, also compatible with Xbox Series and Xbox One. Remaster for PC was announced, to be released in late 2025.

Split-screen on Console allows each player to log into separate Xbox Account, collecting achievements separately. There's a [known issue with launching split-screen co-op on Xbox One](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/amnly6/gears_of_war_2_player_couch_coop_how_to_sign_in/). Log into two accounts in Xbox One Dashboard, _then_ launch the game, press [View and Menu buttons](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/controller/xbox-one-wireless-controller) simultaneously to present Xbox 360 dashboard and select Xbox Live account for Player 2.

"Road to Ruin" DLC (aka "Deleted scene") is free but needs to be "Purchased" and installed separately via Windows Store as "Gears of War 2: All Fronts Collection" if you're playing on Xbox One.

## Gears of War 3

This game is Xbox360 exclusive, also compatible with Xbox Series and Xbox One. Remaster for PC was announced, to be released in late 2025.

Split-screen on Console allows each player to log into separate Xbox Account, collecting achievements separately.

"RAAM's Shadow" DLC is _extra content_ set in GoW universe. It's not included in Game Pass and needs to be purchased separately as "RAAM's Shadow: Pack 2" in Windows Store on Xbox One. It's notable for opportunity to play some missions as enemy faction, with first player controlling RAAM, and other players controlling Locust Elites.

## Gears of War 4

Playable on PC, Xbox Series and Xbox One.

Split-screen on PC is available, but both players will share the same Xbox account. If each player wants to earn their own achievements - play on Xbox Console, or two PCs/Consoles.

## Gears 5

Playable on PC, Xbox Series and Xbox One.

Besides Game Pass, Gears 5 can also be purchased on Steam. Cross-play and cross-save between all platforms and storefronts is implemented via Microsoft/Xbox Account.

Split-screen on PC is available, but all players will share the same Xbox account. If each player wants to earn their own achievements - play on Xbox Console, or two/three PCs/Consoles.

"Hivebusters" DLC is _extra content_ set in GoW universe, but still a fun short co-op campaign. To play Hivebusters DLC, all players in the squad must have active Game Pass, or DLC purchased. Attempting to share one Game Pass subscription results in squad being disbanded immediately after joining. Alternatively, play in split-screen mode.

## Gears of War: E-Day

The 6th mainline game [was announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC20gLfUHeA), rumored to be released in 2026 for PC and Xbox Series.

## Gears of War: Judgment

This game is Xbox360 exclusive, also compatible with Xbox Series and Xbox One.

The story of this game is technically related to mainline games, but is _extra content_ to be played _after_ Gears 5 (and upcoming 2026 Gears: E-Day).

Gameplay-wise, this game is also slightly different from mainline games, being a collection of loosely-connected short missions with optional extra challenge ("Declassified Missions").

After collecting enough stars in the main campaign, an extra chapter "Aftermath" is unlocked, which is a more traditional Gears experience, and story-wise is an alternative view on events of Gears of War 3 campaign.
