# God of War

God of War is an action-adventure game franchise, previously a PlayStation exclusive, released on multiple generations of Sony consoles.

There are two generations/eras of games - original Greek Era, and a modern reboot - Norse Era. In a futile attempt to reduce mental fatigue, this article will consider them entirely separate series.

## Greek Era

While the Greek Era games were very well received, only one of the games is playable on modern hardware, and none of the emulators list these games as 100% compatible. If you don't already own PlayStation consoles, PS3 is a platform that has every game of the Era available.

The order to play Greek Era is not straightforward. Originally, [PSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable) received original games that were prequels to first and second PS2 games respectively, and were later remastered for PS3. While 2013 Ascension game was released last (not counting remasters), it's a prequel, and takes place before every other game of the series.
