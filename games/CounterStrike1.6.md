# Counter-Strike 1.6

## Change a map without dropping players
Use `changelevel` command, e.g. `changelevel de_dust2`

## Mouse sensitivity range
`sensitivity` preference does not go lower than `1.0`, so if you need to go lower - go to Windows Control Panel -> Pointer Options and lower pointer speed. In-game sensitivity value will now result in lower actual mouse sensitivity.
