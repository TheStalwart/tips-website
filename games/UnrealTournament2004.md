# Unreal Tournament 2004

Arena shooter developed by [Digital Extremes](https://www.digitalextremes.com/), nowadays known for [Warframe](/games/Warframe.md).

## 4K resolution and widescreen mode

Build published on Steam does not natively support 4K nor 16:9 aspect ratio. [foxWSFix](https://github.com/alexstrout/foxWSFix-UT2k4) resolves both issues.
