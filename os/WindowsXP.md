## Windows Update
Microsoft does not serve updates for Windows XP anymore, use [Legacy Update](https://legacyupdate.net/) to restore Windows Update functionality.

The website is set up for backwards compatibility with Internet Explorer 6, so just open `http://legacyupdate.net` and go from there.

To retrigger Windows Update Agent: `wuauclt /detectnow`
