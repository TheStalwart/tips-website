## Gaming

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) - native Mac version, quite a few games have native macOS builds
- [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover) - the most complete package of compatibility layers for Windows games
- [Whisky](https://getwhisky.app/) - discontinued, but free UI for [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and [Game Porting Toolkit](https://developer.apple.com/games/game-porting-toolkit/)

## Development tools

- [Kaleidoscope](https://kaleidoscope.app/) - excellent diff app that, unforunately, adopted subscription pricing
- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) - Git UI, probably the best on the market
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) â€” another Git UI, close to Tower, ships with a good diff viewer. Available for both Mac and Windows with an endless free trial
